                                <p>R2D2 is probably the most famous of droids. He has appeared in every movie and series. The stories he could tell. Being an astromech, he'd be good around the house. He'd be one good designated driver, too! He could help with some Python code, as well.</p>

                                <p>BB8 is the new kid on the block, but shows a lot of potential. He's like a cute, little baby droid. He is inquisitive and a quick learner. He is state of the art and one of a kind. And, he's pretty well rounded. He also knows a lot about Css and html.</p>

                                <p>C1-10P is also known as Chopper or Specter 3. He's an older model for an asrtromech, but still functions well. Although he's not very brave, he can be greatly resourceful. He is spunky and says whatever goes through his ciruits. Maybe, it's about Github.</p>

                            <div>
                                <p>Obi-wan, or later known as Ben, Kenobi was a great Jedi knight, master, teacher. You either loved him or hated him. That's funny because that is Sith mentality, and Sith Lords were his speciality. He could mind trick our way to good seats anywhere. These <em>are</em> the seats we're looking for.</p>

                                <p>Yoda, the Grandmaster of the Jedi order, would be a good guy to know. He's 900 years old, so you'd always look young next to him. Plus, you can take him to the casino for some preminitions, or maybe the lottery.</p>

                                <p>Luke Skywalker is the son of Anakin, and, maybe, the most powerful Jedi ever. He could teach me how to fly spaceships and how to blow up really, really big stuff. He could also keep my new droid buddies in working order.</p>

                                <p>Kashyyyk is a forest world and the home of the Wookies. I imagine it would be like camping with hippies. Making friends with Wookies could provide some muscle if I have to move.</p>
